# FLSC Portfolio

Welcome, this is the mono-repo holding my portfolio written in the FLSC stack

## What is the FLSC Stack?

The FLSC is an webapp stack consisting of:

- Filesystem (cc: @rexim), using the filesystem of a host instead of a traditional database.
- libh2o, A library for making webservers in C.
- Svelte, an easy to use yet powerful way of designing a frontend, using the static adapter of course.
- C, which is the language used for the backend, as libmicrohttpd utilizes it.

## What made you even think of this?

Idk, it's funny

### Why is backend submodule not clickable?

Because it's not hosted on github, you'll find it here: <https://git.enstore.cloud/enstore.cloud/toast>

### What is this licensed under?

The frontend is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license, and the backend is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license.
See the LICENSE files [here](LICENSE) and [here](https://git.enstore.cloud/enstore.cloud/toast/src/branch/main/LICENSE) for more information.
