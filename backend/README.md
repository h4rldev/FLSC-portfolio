Hand crafted with some libraries like

- [libmicrohttpd](http://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/) for HTTP server functionality
- [libmagic](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) for "automatic" file mime finding
- [jansson](https://github.com/akheron/jansson) for json parsing and dumping
- [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng) for gzip compression
